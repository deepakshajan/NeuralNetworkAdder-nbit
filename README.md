# NeuralNetworkAdder-nbit

A simple Machine learned Artificial Intelligence program that can potentially perform n bit addition operations.

Although using machine learning to perform simple tasks like addition can be considered an overkill, the purpose of this repository is to build a simple and elegent neural network that includes the basics of machine learning.

This example implements an 8 bit addition operation. However this model approach can be extended to n bits provided that we have the necessary hardware and time to train the neural network model to 100% accuracy. Also we could potentialy extend this method to implement any complex mathematical operations if needed.

All the variables used for training are configurable and can be found in the file [addition_neural_network.py](core/addition_neural_network.py)

Frameworks used are TensorFlow and Keras and python as language.
